        <p class="paragraph">
            Veriscan is a unique technology developed by PAMP Suisse to help eliminate counterfeiting. The idea behind the system is simple. The microscopic topography of the surface of a gold bar makes it possible to assign an individual, unique fingerprint to each bar. When the bars are struck at the refinery, those fingerprints are recorded and catalogued.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            The Fortuna gold-bar design is the most popular on a gold bullion bar today. The Roman goddess of fortune and personification of luck, Fortuna is often depicted with her eyes blindfolded or her face hidden behind a veil. It is not uncommon for a cornucopia to be included in depictions of Fortuna because, as Annonaria, she was considered the protector of grain supplies.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            On the obverse side of these PAMP Suisse Fortuna 1 oz. Gold Bar is the image of Fortuna. Wearing a blindfold over her eyes and a cornucopia on her head, Fortunas clasped hands capture the overflowing bounty of riches from her cornucopia. The reverse side of the bar features the PAMP Suisse corporate logo, the bars weight, metal content, and purity, as well as the assayers mark and serial number.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
